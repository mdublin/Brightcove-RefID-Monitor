create postgres db with SQLAlchemy wrapper

db will store all tennis videos (video id, title, and ref id as either None or id)

will keep parsing the feed

when video found, that already exists in db and now has ref id, ref id is added to column and date/time is recorded (HOW DO I DO THIS?)

will keep parsing the feed

(separate script needed to check db for this constantly?):

when video with ref id is 24 hours old, i.e. when a 24 hours period has passed before assignment of ref id and current time, email alert will be sent using builtin in Python email packageâ€¦.
